 While developing the Brick Breaker game, I had the opportunity to learn and apply various features of JavaScript. During this process, I gained experience in the following subjects:

 JavaScript Random Feature: I learned how to create random values â€‹â€‹and use them in game mechanics. For example, I have used the random function effectively in situations such as placing bricks in a random manner or determining the initial speed of the ball.

 Using CSS with JavaScriptâ€‹: I learned to manipulate CSS properties via JavaScript to deliver a dynamic user experience. I was able to change properties of elements in the game, such as color, size or position, in real time. This made the visuals and interaction of the game more interesting.

 Event Management: I improved my ability to manage events (event listeners) that react according to the user's mouse or keyboard input within the game mechanics. In this way, player movements and other interactions in the game became more fluid.

 This project provided an experience that was both fun and educational, allowing me to better understand and apply JavaScript. In summary, the Brick Breaker game development process has been a valuable learning opportunity for me. ðŸ˜Š
